The methodology for the advanced security system utilizing the ESP32-CAM integrates a cohesive approach to leveraging the specified components for creating a robust smart lock solution. The ESP32-CAM WiFi Bluetooth Development Board with OV2640 Camera Module serves as the central processing and surveillance unit, providing wireless connectivity for remote access and high-quality image capture. The system incorporates an FT232RL USB to TTL 3.3V 5V Serial Adapter Module, which facilitates seamless programming and debugging of the ESP32-CAM during development.
To enhance the locking mechanism, a 12V Electronic Door Lock assembly solenoid is employed for secure physical locking and unlocking, featuring low power consumption for efficiency. A 5V Single Channel RELAY Module acts as an interface between the ESP32-CAM and the solenoid lock, ensuring safe control of high-power operations. The integration of 20cm Female to Female Jumper Cable Wires ensures easy and flexible connections between the components.
Firmware development using Arduino IDE focuses on implementing core functionalities such as video streaming, motion detection, and face recognition. When an authorized face is detected or a mobile app command is received, the ESP32-CAM triggers the relay module to control the electronic lock. Real-time alerts and remote access are enabled via WiFi. The hardware is tested and mounted in durable enclosures suitable for both bike and home lock applications, ensuring portability and security. This integrated approach delivers a smart, energy-efficient, and scalable solution for modern security requirements.
