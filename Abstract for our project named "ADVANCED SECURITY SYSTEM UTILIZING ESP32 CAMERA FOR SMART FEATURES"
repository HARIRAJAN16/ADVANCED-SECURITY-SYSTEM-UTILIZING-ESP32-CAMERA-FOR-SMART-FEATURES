Abstract:
This paper introduces an advanced smart security system designed for bike and home locks, utilizing the ESP32-CAM WiFi Bluetooth Development Board with OV2640 Camera Module. The system combines real-time video monitoring, motion detection, and face recognition to enhance traditional locking mechanisms with smart features. Leveraging the ESP32-CAM’s WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity, the solution enables remote access, real-time alerts, and secure unlocking via authorized facial identification or mobile app controls. The OV2640 camera module ensures high-quality image capture for reliable recognition, while the system’s compact and energy-efficient design makes it ideal for portable and stationary security applications. This IoT-enabled approach redefines lock systems, offering enhanced security, convenience, and scalability for personal and residential use.
